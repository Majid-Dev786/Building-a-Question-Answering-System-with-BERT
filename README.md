# Building a Question Answering System with BERT

## Description

This project demonstrates the creation of a Question Answering (QA) system leveraging the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a pre-trained transformer model by Google. 

BERT has revolutionized the way natural language processing tasks are handled, providing a new architecture for NLP. 

Our project uses TensorFlow and Hugging Face's Transformers library to predict answers to questions given a context paragraph.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the necessary packages installed. 

Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sorena-Dev/Building-a-Question-Answering-System-with-BERT.git
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install tensorflow transformers
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the script `Building a Question Answering System with BERT.py` to see the QA system in action. The script demonstrates how to:

- Tokenize the input context and questions using BERT's tokenizer.
- Predict answers to the questions based on the context.
- Decode and print the predicted answers alongside the true answers for comparison.

This project can be adapted for various real-world scenarios, such as building chatbots, automating customer support, and enhancing search engines.

## Features

- Utilization of the BERT model for understanding context and question semantics.
- Easy to adapt for different contexts and questions.
- Demonstrates the integration of TensorFlow and Hugging Face's Transformers.
